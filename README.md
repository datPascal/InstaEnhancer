Privacy Policy – InstaEnhancer
Last updated: 5 September 2025

Thank you for choosing InstaEnhancer (“the App”, “we”, “our”). Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains what information the App touches, how it is processed, and why no personal data is permanently stored on servers under our control.

We do not collect, store, or share personal data on our servers. All photo processing happens on your device.

Information the App Touches
1.1 Photos
• The photo you select (from your camera or photo library) is processed entirely on your device to enhance images for social media (for example: filters, lighting and color adjustments, cropping and resizing, background blur/replacement, retouching, noise reduction, and upscaling).
• No copy of your image leaves your device unless you explicitly export or share it.

1.2 Saved Edits, Drafts, and Presets (Optional)
• If you choose to save edited versions, drafts, or custom presets, they are stored only in the App’s private container on your device (and, if you have iCloud Backup enabled, inside your own iCloud account).
• We cannot see, access, or retrieve these files.

1.3 Purchase Records (Optional)
• If you buy Pro features, tokens, or other in‑app purchases, Apple provides us with an anonymized transaction receipt that contains no personal identifiers. The receipt is stored in your device‑local Keychain solely so the App knows that you have already paid.

1.4 Diagnostics (Optional)
• When you opt in to Apple’s “Share With App Developers,” Apple may forward de‑identified crash logs and usage statistics. These logs do not include photos or any information that could directly identify you.

How We Use This Information
• To apply the image enhancements you request.
• To validate and remember your unlocked features after an in‑app purchase.
• To improve reliability and performance if you opted in to share diagnostics.
We do not use any information for advertising, tracking, or profiling.
Where Your Data Lives
• Your device – original and edited photos, saved drafts/presets, purchase receipts.
• Apple iCloud (only if you have iCloud Backup turned on) – encrypted device backup that includes the App’s data.
We run no servers that store personal data, and the App never uploads your photos to us or to third parties.
Your Rights & Choices
Because all personal content remains under your control, you can:
• Delete edited photos, drafts, or presets at any time from within the App or the Photos app.
• Remove the App to erase local files and Keychain receipts; you may also delete the App’s iCloud backup in iOS Settings ▸ Apple ID ▸ iCloud ▸ Manage Storage.
• Turn off “Share With App Developers” in iOS Settings ▸ Privacy & Security ▸ Analytics & Improvements to stop diagnostic sharing.
If you contact us asking for deletion, we can only instruct you on the steps above, as we hold no data capable of being erased on your behalf.

Security
• All processing happens locally; no network transmission of your photos occurs.
• Any communication with Apple’s servers (e.g., in‑app purchases) is encrypted with HTTPS/TLS.
• Apple Keychain and iCloud Backup encrypt data at rest and in transit.
Children
InstaEnhancer is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy as the App evolves. New versions will appear here and inside the App. Continued use after an update means you accept the revised policy.
